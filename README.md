# MetaCrafters ETH+AVAX Proof Error Handling Assessment

This assessment is part of the MetaCrafters ETH+AVAX Proof course

The course provides in-depth knowledge into functions and error handling in Solidity

In this assessment, we had to show the implementation of Error Handling in Solidity

Error handling in programming is a procedure to handle errors that occur during runtime of a program. It helps us handle the interruption and perform some other instructions in response to the error.

In solidity, error handling is implemented using three main functions: require, revert and assert.
